# The Mascot: Ferris

**Ferris** is the unofficial mascot of the Rust community. He is a crab because Rust programmers often call themselves "Rustaceans" (a play on the word crustacean).

### Why a crab?
- Rustaceans are known for being friendly and helpful.
- Crabs have hard shells (like Rust's safety guarantees).
- They have powerful claws (like Rust's powerful type system).

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Ferris!");
}
```
